ðŸ’» About Me

    Although I'm passionate about coding, I'm not a developer yet.
    Currently, I'm learning a lot about development, especially how to learn to code.
    I'm open to collaborating on various projects and exploring different working methods around the world.
    âœ¨ Looking forward to connecting and/or collaborating with you! âœ¨
